I'm working through the first 3 chapters of [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

This repo contains only the coding exercises.

You can find the conceptual and proof exercises in my notes linked below. I've also written some of the formula with KaTeX since they are difficult to make out in the book.
